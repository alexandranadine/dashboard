<h1>The Odin Project: User Dashboard</h1>
<p><b>v.1:</b></p>
<p>I have created a user dashboard. Goals of the project were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use knowledge of CSS Grid and Flexbox to replicate a user dashboard layout provided by TOP</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 9/22, this project is completed. I may come back to it in the future though.</p>
